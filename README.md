# E-Commerce Store for Suits, Footwear, and Pants

Welcome to my **beginner-friendly e-commerce site**, showcasing suits, footwear, and pants. This project was a hands-on experiment to learn **web animations, interactive carousels, and modern front-end techniques**.

## Main Features

- **Animation on Scroll** using Intersection Observer  
- **Infinite Carousel** for products  
- Smooth **hover and transition effects** for a dynamic user experience  
- Responsive design for multiple devices (media queries AI-generated)  
- Embedded **11 MB video and singular background sound** for demonstration purposes

## About This Project

This project was built as a **learning experiment**, so some assets (images, videos, sound) and media queries were **AI-generated** to help me focus on **animations and front-end logic**.  

I experimented with:

- Scroll-triggered animations
- Product carousels that loop infinitely
- Intersection Observer API for smooth element appearance  
- Responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile  

## Notes

- **Video Size**: 11 MB â€” used to demonstrate video embedding, animations, and responsiveness  
- **Sound**: Single audio track for simple background audio  
- **Learning Focus**: This project helped me understand how animations, scroll effects, and interactive components work together on a real webpage
